# Pympress

[Pympress](https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress) is a PDF presentation tool designed for dual-screen setups such as presentations and public talks. Highly configurable, fully-featured, and portable


## Speaker Notes

```typst
#import "@preview/touying:0.4.0": *

#let s = themes.university.register(aspect-ratio: "16-9")

// Set the speaker notes configuration, you can show it by pympress
#let s = (s.methods.show-notes-on-second-screen)(self: s, right)

#let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert, speaker-note) = utils.methods(s)
#show: init

#let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s)
#show: slides

= Animation

== Simple Animation

We can use `#pause` to #pause display something later.

#pause

Just like this.

#meanwhile

Meanwhile, #pause we can also use `#meanwhile` to #pause display other content synchronously.

#speaker-note[
  + This is a speaker note.
  + You won't see it unless you use `#let s = (s.math.show-notes-on-second-screen)(self: s, right)`
]
```
