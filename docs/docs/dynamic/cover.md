# Cover Function

As you already know, both `uncover` and `#pause` use the `cover` function to conceal content that is not visible. So, what exactly is the `cover` function here?

## Default Cover Function: `hide`

The `cover` function is a method stored in `store.methods.cover`, which is later used by `uncover` and `#pause`.

The default `cover` function is the [hide](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/hide/) function. This function makes the internal content invisible without affecting the layout.

## Updating the Cover Function

In some cases, you might want to use your own `cover` function. In that case, you can set your own `cover` function using:

```typst
let store = (store.methods.update-cover)(self: store, is-method: true, cover-fn)
```

Here, if you set `is-method: false`, Touying will wrap `cover-fn` into a method for you.

## Semi-Transparent Cover Function

Touying supports a semi-transparent cover function, which can be enabled by adding:

```typst
#let store = (store.methods.enable-transparent-cover)(self: store)
```

You can adjust the transparency through the `alpha: ..` parameter.

:::warning[Warning]

Note that the `transparent-cover` here does not preserve text layout like `hide` does because it adds an extra layer of `box`, which may disrupt the original structure of the page.

:::tip[Internals]

The `enable-transparent-cover` method is defined as:

```typst
#let store.methods.enable-transparent-cover = (
  self: none,
  constructor: rgb,
  alpha: 85%,
) => {
  self.methods.cover = (self: none, body) => {
    utils.cover-with-rect(
      fill: utils.update-alpha(
        constructor: constructor,
        self.page-args.fill,
        alpha,
      ),
      body
    )
  }
  self
}
```

It creates a semi-transparent rectangular mask with the same color as the background to simulate the effect of transparent content. Here, `constructor: rgb` and `alpha: 85%` indicate the background color's construction function and transparency level, respectively.
