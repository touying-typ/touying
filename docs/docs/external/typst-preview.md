# Typst Preview

The Typst Preview extension for VS Code provides an excellent slide mode, allowing us to preview and present slides.

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and type `Typst Preview: Preview current file in slide mode` to open the preview in slide mode.

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and type `Typst Preview: Preview current file in browser and slide mode` to open the slide mode in the browser.

Now, you can press keys like `F11` to enter fullscreen mode in the browser, making it suitable for slide presentations.

Since Typst Preview is based on SVG, it can play GIF animations, which is very helpful for dynamic slides.
