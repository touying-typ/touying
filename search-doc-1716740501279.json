Specifically, you need to introduce these three functions as follows:  #slide(repeat: 3, self =&gt; [ #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self) In subslide #self.subslide, test #uncover(&quot;2-&quot;)[uncover] function, and test #only(&quot;2-&quot;)[only] function, #pause and paused text. ])     Notice that we no longer pass a content block but instead pass a callback function with a self parameter. Later, we extract only, uncover, and alternatives functions from self using:  #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)   We then call these functions in subsequent steps.  Here's an interesting fact: the self.subslide of type int indicates the current subslide index, and in fact, the only, uncover, and alternatives functions rely on self.subslide to determine the current subslide index.  Warning We manually specify the repeat: 3 parameter, indicating the display of 3 subslides.

You can write your slides in a &quot;content and style separation&quot; manner, especially with Typst, which offers a concise yet powerful syntax, better supporting content like code blocks, mathematical formulas, and theorems. Another advantage is that, with templates, writing slides with Touying is much faster than PowerPoint. Therefore, Touying is more suitable for users with a demand for &quot;research writing.&quot;Compared to Markdown Slides, Touying, relying on Typst, has more powerful typesetting control, such as headers, footers, layout, and convenient custom functions. These are capabilities that Markdown struggles to provide, or does not do well. Additionally, Touying offers #pause and #meanwhile markers, providing more convenient dynamic slide capabilities.Compared to Beamer, Touying has faster compilation speed, a more concise syntax, and simpler theme customization capabilities. Touying's compilation speed can be maintained in milliseconds or tens of milliseconds, compared to Beamer's compilation time of seconds or tens of seconds. Touying's syntax is more concise than Beamer, making it easier to change templates and create your own templates. In terms of features, Touying supports most of Beamer's capabilities and provides some convenient features that Beamer lacks.Compared to Polylux, Touying provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style syntax, allowing the simulation of &quot;global variables&quot; through a global singleton. This makes it easy to write themes. Touying does not rely on counter and locate to implement #pause, resulting in better performance.

You should know that Typst is a typesetting language that supports incremental rendering. That is, Typst caches the results of previous function calls. This requires Typst to have only pure functions, meaning functions that do not change external variables. Therefore, it's challenging to modify a global variable in the true sense, as done in LaTeX. Even if you use state or counter, you need to use locate and callback functions to access their values, and this approach has a significant impact on performance. Touying does not use state and counter, nor does it violate the Internals of Typst's pure functions. Instead, it cleverly uses a method in an object-oriented style to maintain a global singleton s. In Touying, an object refers to a Typst dictionary with its own member variables and methods. We have a convention that methods have a named parameter self to pass the object itself, and all methods are placed in the .methods domain. With this concept, it's not difficult to write a method to update info: #let s = ( info: (:), methods: ( // update info info: (self: none, ..args) =&gt; { self.info += args.named() self }, ) ) #let s = (s.methods.info)(self: s, title: [title]) Title is #s.info.title This way, you can also understand the purpose of the utils.methods() function: it binds self to all methods of s and returns it. It simplifies the subsequent use through unpacking syntax. #let (init, slide, slides) = utils.methods(s)   ","version":"0.2.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Sections and Subsections​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Layout Your Contents","url":"/touying/docs/0.2.x/layout#sections-and-subsections","content":" Similar to Beamer, Touying also has the concepts of sections and subsections.  In the #show: slides mode, sections and subsections correspond to first-level and second-level titles, respectively. For example:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.2.1&quot;: * #let (init, slide, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show: slides = Section == Subsection Hello, Touying!     However, the second-level title does not always correspond to the subsection. The specific mapping may vary depending on the theme.  In the more general #slide[..] mode, sections and subsections are passed as parameters to the slide function, for example:  #slide(section: [Let's start a new section!])[..] #slide(subsection: [Let's start a new subsection!])[..]   This will create a new section and a new subsection, respectively. However, this change typically only affects the internal sections state of Touying and is not displayed on the slide by default. The specific display may vary depending on the theme.  Note that the section and subsection parameters of slide can accept both content blocks and arrays in the format ([title], [short-title]) or dictionaries in the format (title: [title], short-title: [short-title]). The short-title will be used in some special cases, such as in the navigation of the dewdrop theme.

Instead, you should modify the s.page-args member variable inside s.  This way, we can query the parameters of the current page in real-time using s.page-args.

Later, we extract only, uncover, and alternatives functions from self using:  #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)   We then call these functions in subsequent steps.  Here's an interesting fact: the self.subslide of type int indicates the current subslide index, and in fact, the only, uncover, and alternatives functions rely on self.subslide to determine the current subslide index.

This is because the simple theme registers an s.methods.touying-new-section-slide method, so Touying will automatically call this method.  If we don't want it to automatically create such a section slide, we can delete this method:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #(s.methods.touying-new-section-slide = none) #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = Title == First Slide Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst!     As you can see, there are only two pages left, and the default section slide is gone.

Similarly, we can modify s.methods.touying-new-subsection-slide to do the same for subsection.  In fact, besides s.methods.touying-new-section-slide, another special slide function is the s.methods.slide function, which will be called by default in simple style when #slide[...] is not explicitly used.  Also, since #slide[...] is registered in s.slides = (&quot;slide&quot;,), the section, subsection, and title parameters will be automatically passed, while others like #focus-slide[...] will not automatically receive these three parameters.  Principle In fact, you can also not use #show: slides and utils.slides(s), but only use utils.methods(s), for example: #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #let (init, touying-outline, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(section: [Title], title: [First Slide])[ Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst! ] Here, you need to manually pass in section, subsection, and title, but it will have better performance, suitable for cases where faster performance is needed, such as when there are more than dozens or hundreds of pages.

Generally, the first step in creating slides is to determine font size and page aspect ratio. Therefore, we need to register an initialization method:  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]   As you can see, we created a register function and passed an aspect-ratio parameter to set the page aspect ratio. We get default self by self: themes.default.register(). As you might already know, in Touying, we should not use set page(..) to set page parameters but rather use the syntax self.page-args += (..) to set them, as explained in the Page Layout section.  In addition, we registered a self.methods.init method, which can be used for some global style settings. For example, in this case, we added set text(size: 20pt) to set the font size. You can also place additional global style settings here, such as set par(justify: true). Since the init function is placed inside self.methods, it is a method, not a regular function. Therefore, we need to add the parameter self: none to use it properly.  As you can see, later in main.typ, we apply the global style settings in init using #show: init, where init is bound and unpacked through utils.methods(s).  If you pay extra attention, you'll notice that the register function has an independent self at the end. This actually represents returning the modified self as the return value, which will be saved in #let s = ... This line is therefore indispensable.

Touying provides built-in color theme support to minimize API differences between different themes. Touying offers two dimensions of color selection: the first is neutral, primary, secondary, and tertiary for hue distinction, with primary being the most commonly used; the second is default, light, lighter, lightest, dark, darker, and darkest for brightness distinction.  As we are creating the Bamboo theme, we chose a color for the primary theme, similar to bamboo (rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;)), and included neutral lightest/darkest as background and font colors.  As shown in the code below, we use (self.methods.colors)(self: self, ..) to modify the color theme. Essentially, it is a wrapper for self.colors += (..).  #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self }   After adding the color theme, we can access the color using syntax like self.colors.primary.  It's worth noting that users can change the theme color at any time using:  #let s = (s.methods.colors)(self: s, primary: rgb(&quot;#3578B9&quot;))   This flexibility demonstrates Touying's powerful customization capabilities.

Typically, #alert[..] emphasizes text using the primary theme color for aesthetics. We add a line in the register function:  self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it)   This code sets the text color to self.colors.primary, utilizing the theme's primary color.  ","version":"0.3.2+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Header and Footer​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.2+/build-your-own-theme#custom-header-and-footer","content":" Here, assuming you've already read the Page Layout section, we know we should add headers and footers to the slides.  Firstly, we add self.bamboo-title = []. This means we save the title of the current slide as a member variable self.bamboo-title, stored in self. This makes it easy to use in the header and later modifications. Similarly, we create self.bamboo-footer, saving the footer: [] parameter from the register function for displaying in the bottom-left corner.  It's worth noting that our header is actually a content function in the form of let header(self) = { .. } with the self parameter, allowing us to get the latest information from self. For example, self.bamboo-title. The footer is similar.  The components.cell used inside is actually #let cell = block.with(width: 100%, height: 100%, above: 0pt, below: 0pt, breakable: false), and show: components.cell is shorthand for components.cell(body). The show: pad.with(.4em) in the footer is similar.  Another point to note is the states module, which contains many counters and state-related content. For example, states.current-section-title is used to display the current section, and states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number is used to display the current page number and total number of pages.  We observe the usage of utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) to display self.bamboo-footer. This is used to handle situations like self.bamboo-footer = (self) =&gt; {..}, ensuring a unified approach to displaying content functions and content.  To ensure proper display of the header and footer and sufficient spacing from the main content, we also set top and bottom margins and left and right padding, such as self.page-args += (margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 0em)) and self.padding = (x: 2em, y: 0em). The left and right margin is 0em to allow the header to occupy the full page width. The left and right spacing of the main content is achieved through left and right padding of 2em.  We also need to customize a slide method that accepts slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args). The first self: none is a required method parameter for getting the latest self. The second title is used to update self.bamboo-title for displaying in the header. The third ..args collects the remaining parameters and passes them to (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args), which is necessary for the Touying slide functionality to work properly. Additionally, we need to register this method in the register function with self.methods.slide = slide.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 0em), ) self.padding = (x: 2em, y: 0em) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]     ","version":"0.3.2+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Special Slide​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.2+/build-your-own-theme#custom-special-slide","content":" Building upon the basic slide, we further add some special slide functions such as title-slide, focus-slide, and a custom slides method.  For the title-slide method, first, we call self = utils.empty-page(self). This function clears self.page-args.header, self.page-args.footer, and sets margin and padding to 0em, creating a blank page effect. Then, we use let info = self.info + args.named() to get information stored in self.info and update it with the passed args.named() for later use as info.title. The specific page content body will vary for each theme, so we won't go into details here. Finally, we call `(self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body  ), where repeat: noneindicates that this page does not require animation effects, and passing thebody` parameter displays its content.  For the new-section-slide method, the process is similar. The only thing to note is that in (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body), we pass an additional section: section parameter to declare the creation of a new section. Another point to note is that besides self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide, we also register self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide, so new-section-slide will be automatically called when encountering a first-level title.  For the focus-slide method, most of the content is similar, but it's worth noting that we use self.page-args += (..) to update the page's background color.  Finally, we update the slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) method. When title-slide is true, using #show: slides will automatically create a title-slide. Setting slide-level: 1 indicates that the first-level and second-level titles correspond to section and title, respectively.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let title-slide(self: none, ..args) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let info = self.info + args.named() let body = { set align(center + horizon) block( fill: self.colors.primary, width: 80%, inset: (y: 1em), radius: 1em, text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, info.title) ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest) if info.author != none { block(info.author) } if info.date != none { block(if type(info.date) == datetime { info.date.display(self.datetime-format) } else { info.date }) } } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body) } #let new-section-slide(self: none, section) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let body = { set align(center + horizon) set text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.primary, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, style: &quot;italic&quot;) section } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body) } #let focus-slide(self: none, body) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) self.page-args += ( fill: self.colors.primary, margin: 2em, ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: 2em) (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, align(horizon + center, body)) } #let slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) = { if title-slide { (self.methods.title-slide)(self: self) } (self.methods.touying-slides)(self: self, slide-level: slide-level, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 0em), ) self.padding = (x: 2em, y: 0em) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.title-slide = title-slide self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.focus-slide = focus-slide self.methods.slides = slides self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], ) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide, title-slide, focus-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ] #focus-slide[ Focus on it! ]     ","version":"0.3.2+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.2+/build-your-own-theme#conclusion","content":" Congratulations!

Themes in Touying encapsulate some of their own global styles, which are placed in #show: init. For example, the university theme encapsulates the following:  self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 25pt) show footnote.entry: set text(size: .6em) body }   If you are not a theme creator but want to add your own global styles to your slides, you can simply place them after #show: init and before #show: slides. For example, the metropolis theme recommends adding the following global styles:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init // global styles #set text(font: &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, weight: &quot;light&quot;, size: 20pt) #show math.equation: set text(font: &quot;Fira Math&quot;) #set strong(delta: 100) #set par(justify: true) #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide, title-slide, new-section-slide, focus-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides   However, note that you should not use #set page(..).

Global information is a typical example of this.  You can set the title, subtitle, author, date, and institution information for slides using:  #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], )   In subsequent slides, you can access them through s.info or self.info.  This information is generally used in the title-slide, header, and footer of the theme, for example:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution)   The date can accept datetime format or content format, and the display format for the datetime format can be changed using:  #let s = (s.methods.datetime-format)(self: s, &quot;[year]-[month]-[day]&quot;)   Principle Here, we will introduce a bit of OOP concept in Touying. You should know that Typst is a typesetting language that supports incremental rendering, which means Typst caches the results of previous function calls. This requires that Typst consists of pure functions, meaning functions that do not change external variables. Thus, it is challenging to modify a global variable in the true sense, even with the use of state or counter. This would require the use of locate with callback functions to obtain the values inside, and this approach would have a significant impact on performance. Touying does not use state or counter and does not violate the principle of pure functions in Typst. Instead, it uses a clever approach in an object-oriented style, maintaining a global singleton s. In Touying, an object refers to a Typst dictionary with its own member variables and methods. We agree that methods all have a named parameter self for passing the object itself, and methods are placed in the .methods domain. With this concept, it becomes easier to write methods to update info: #let s = ( info: (:), methods: ( // update info info: (self: none, ..args) =&gt; { self.info += args.named() self }, ) ) #let s = (s.methods.info)(self: s, title: [title]) Title is #s.info.title Now you can understand the purpose of the utils.methods() function: to bind self to all methods of s and return it, simplifying the subsequent usage through unpacking syntax. #let (init, slides, alert) = utils.methods(s)   ","version":"0.3.2+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"State Initialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Global Settings","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.2+/global-settings#state-initialization","content":" In general, the two ways mentioned above are sufficient for adding global settings. However, there are still situations where we need to initialize counters or states. If you place this code before #show: slides, a blank page will be created, which is something we don't want to see. In such cases, you can use the s.methods.append-preamble method. For example, when using the codly package:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/codly:0.2.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let s = (s.methods.append-preamble)(self: s)[ #codly(languages: ( rust: (name: &quot;Rust&quot;, icon: &quot;\\u{fa53}&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#CE412B&quot;)), )) ] #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show heading.where(level: 2): set block(below: 1em) #show: init #show: codly-init.with() #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides #slide[ == First slide #raw(lang: &quot;rust&quot;, block: true, `pub fn main() { println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;); }`.text) ]     Or when configuring Pdfpc:  // Pdfpc configuration // typst query --root . ./example.typ --field value --one &quot;&lt;pdfpc-file&gt;&quot; &gt; ./example.pdfpc #let s = (s.methods.append-preamble)(self: s, pdfpc.config( duration-minutes: 30, start-time: datetime(hour: 14, minute: 10, second: 0), end-time: datetime(hour: 14, minute: 40, second: 0), last-minutes: 5, note-font-size: 12, disable-markdown: false, default-transition: ( type: &quot;push&quot;, duration-seconds: 2, angle: ltr, alignment: &quot;vertical&quot;, direction: &quot;inward&quot;, ), ))  ","version":"0.3.2+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"MiTeX","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.2+/integration/mitex","content":"MiTeX During the process of creating slides, we often already have a LaTeX math equation that we simply want to paste into the slides without transcribing it into a Typst math equation.

You can write your slides in a &quot;content and style separation&quot; manner, especially with Typst, which offers a concise yet powerful syntax, better supporting content like code blocks, mathematical formulas, and theorems. Another advantage is that, with templates, writing slides with Touying is much faster than PowerPoint. Therefore, Touying is more suitable for users with a demand for &quot;research writing.&quot;Compared to Markdown Slides, Touying, relying on Typst, has more powerful typesetting control, such as headers, footers, layout, and convenient custom functions. These are capabilities that Markdown struggles to provide, or does not do well. Additionally, Touying offers #pause and #meanwhile markers, providing more convenient dynamic slide capabilities.Compared to Beamer, Touying has faster compilation speed, a more concise syntax, and simpler theme customization capabilities. Touying's compilation speed can be maintained in milliseconds or tens of milliseconds, compared to Beamer's compilation time of seconds or tens of seconds. Touying's syntax is more concise than Beamer, making it easier to change templates and create your own templates. In terms of features, Touying supports most of Beamer's capabilities and provides some convenient features that Beamer lacks.Compared to Polylux, Touying provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style syntax, allowing the simulation of &quot;global variables&quot; through a global singleton. This makes it easy to write themes. Touying does not rely on counter and locate to implement #pause, resulting in better performance.

If you don't care about customizing the page style, you can choose to skip this section. However, it is still recommended to go through this part.  Here, we illustrate Typst's default page model with a specific example.  #let container = rect.with(height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;)) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, header: container[#innerbox[Header]], header-ascent: 30%, footer: container[#innerbox[Footer]], footer-descent: 30%, ) #let padding = (x: 2em, y: 2em) #place(top + right)[Margin→] #container[ #place[Padding] #pad(..padding)[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ] ]     We need to distinguish the following concepts:  Model: Typst has a model similar to the CSS Box Model, divided into Margin, Padding, and Content. However, padding is not a property of set page(..) but is obtained manually by adding #pad(..).Margin: Margins, including top, bottom, left, and right, are the core of Typst's page model. Other properties are influenced by margins, especially Header and Footer, which are actually inside the Margin.Padding: Used to add additional space between Margin and Content.Header: The Header is the content at the top of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can notice that the edge of the header container and padding does not align but has a certain gap. This gap is actually header-ascent: 30%, and the percentage is relative to margin-top. Also, we notice that the header innerbox is actually located at the bottom left corner of the header container, meaning the innerbox defaults to #set align(left + bottom).Footer: The Footer is the content at the bottom of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can notice that the edge of the footer container and padding does not align but has a certain gap. This gap is actually footer-descent: 30%, and the percentage is relative to margin-bottom. Also, we notice that the footer innerbox is actually located at the top left corner of the footer container, meaning the innerbox defaults to #set align(left + top).Place: The place function can achieve absolute positioning, relative to the parent container, without affecting other elements within the parent container. It can take parameters like alignment, dx, and dy, making it suitable for placing decorative elements such as logos.  Therefore, to apply Typst to create slides, we only need to set  #set page( margin: (x: 0em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, ) #let padding = (x: 4em, y: 0em)   For example, we have  #let container = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;), height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(fill: rgb(&quot;#d0d0d0&quot;)) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, margin: (x: 0em, y: 2em), header: container[#align(top)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Header]]], header-ascent: 0em, footer: container[#align(bottom)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Footer]]], footer-descent: 0em, ) #let padding = (x: 4em, y: 0em) #place(top + right)[↑Margin] #container[ #place[Padding] #pad(..padding)[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ] ]     ","version":"0.3.2+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Page Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Page Layout","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.2+/layout#page-management","content":" Since using the set page(..) command in Typst to modify page parameters creates a new page and cannot modify the current one, Touying chooses to maintain an s.page-args member variable and an s.padding member variable. Touying applies these parameters only when creating new slides, so users only need to focus on s.page-args and s.padding.  For example, the previous example can be transformed into  #(s.page-args += ( margin: (x: 0em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, )) #(s.padding += (x: 4em, y: 0em))   Similarly, if you are not satisfied with the header or footer style of a theme, you can use  #(s.page-args.footer = [Custom Footer])   to replace it. However, please note that if you replace the page parameters in this way, you need to place it before #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s), or you need to call #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) again.  Warning Therefore, you should not use the set page(..) command on your own; instead, you should modify the s.page-args member variable internally.  In this way, we can also query the current page parameters in real-time through s.page-args. This is useful for some functions that need to get margin or the current page's background color, such as transparent-cover. This is partly equivalent to the context get rule, and it is actually more convenient to use.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the required size and position of the logo often vary from person to person. Therefore, most of Touying's themes do not include configuration options for logos. But with the concepts of page layout mentioned in this section, we know that we can use the place function in the header or footer to place a logo image.  For example, suppose we decide to add the GitHub icon to the metropolis theme. We can implement it like this:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.3&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/octique:0.1.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #(s.page-args.header = self =&gt; { // display the original header utils.call-or-display(self, s.page-args.header) // place logo at the top-right place(top + right, dx: -0.5em, dy: 0.3em)[ #octique(&quot;mark-github&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#fafafa&quot;), width: 1.5em, height: 1.5em) ] }) #let (init, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(title: [Title])[ Logo example. ]     Here, utils.call-or-display(self, body) can be used to display body as content or a callback function in the form self =&gt; content.

Later, we extract only, uncover, and alternatives functions from self using:  #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)   We then call these functions in subsequent steps.  Here's an interesting fact: the self.subslide of type int indicates the current subslide index, and in fact, the only, uncover, and alternatives functions rely on self.subslide to determine the current subslide index.  Warning We manually specify the repeat: 3 parameter, indicating the display of 3 subslides.

Generally, the first step in creating slides is to determine font size and page aspect ratio. Therefore, we need to register an initialization method:  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #let register( aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, self, ) = { self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide,) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]   As you can see, we created a register function and passed an aspect-ratio parameter to set the page aspect ratio. As you might already know, in Touying, we should not use set page(..) to set page parameters but rather use the syntax self.page-args += (..) to set them, as explained in the Page Layout section.  In addition, we registered a self.methods.init method, which can be used for some global style settings. For example, in this case, we added set text(size: 20pt) to set the font size. You can also place additional global style settings here, such as set par(justify: true). Since the init function is placed inside self.methods, it is a method, not a regular function. Therefore, we need to add the parameter self: none to use it properly.  As you can see, later in main.typ, we apply the global style settings in init using #show: init, where init is bound and unpacked through utils.methods(s).  If you pay extra attention, you'll notice that the register function has an independent self at the end. This actually represents returning the modified self as the return value, which will be saved in #let s = ... This line is therefore indispensable.

Touying provides built-in color theme support to minimize API differences between different themes. Touying offers two dimensions of color selection: the first is neutral, primary, secondary, and tertiary for hue distinction, with primary being the most commonly used; the second is default, light, lighter, lightest, dark, darker, and darkest for brightness distinction.  As we are creating the Bamboo theme, we chose a color for the primary theme, similar to bamboo (rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;)), and included neutral lightest/darkest as background and font colors.  As shown in the code below, we use (self.methods.colors)(self: self, ..) to modify the color theme. Essentially, it is a wrapper for self.colors += (..).  #let register( aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, self, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self }   After adding the color theme, we can access the color using syntax like self.colors.primary.  It's worth noting that users can change the theme color at any time using:  #let s = (s.methods.colors)(self: s, primary: rgb(&quot;#3578B9&quot;))   This flexibility demonstrates Touying's powerful customization capabilities.  ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Practical: Custom Alert Method​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/build-your-own-theme#practical-custom-alert-method","content":" In general, we need to provide a #alert[..] function for users, similar to #strong[..]. Typically, #alert[..] emphasizes text using the primary theme color for aesthetics. We add a line in the register function:  self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it)   This code sets the text color to self.colors.primary, utilizing the theme's primary color.  ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Header and Footer​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/build-your-own-theme#custom-header-and-footer","content":" Here, assuming you've already read the Page Layout section, we know we should add headers and footers to the slides.  Firstly, we add self.bamboo-title = []. This means we save the title of the current slide as a member variable self.bamboo-title, stored in self. This makes it easy to use in the header and later modifications. Similarly, we create self.bamboo-footer, saving the footer: [] parameter from the register function for displaying in the bottom-left corner.  It's worth noting that our header is actually a content function in the form of let header(self) = { .. } with the self parameter, allowing us to get the latest information from self. For example, self.bamboo-title. The footer is similar.  The components.cell used inside is actually #let cell = block.with(width: 100%, height: 100%, above: 0pt, below: 0pt, breakable: false), and show: components.cell is shorthand for components.cell(body). The show: pad.with(.4em) in the footer is similar.  Another point to note is the states module, which contains many counters and state-related content. For example, states.current-section-title is used to display the current section, and states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number is used to display the current page number and total number of pages.  We observe the usage of utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) to display self.bamboo-footer. This is used to handle situations like self.bamboo-footer = (self) =&gt; {..}, ensuring a unified approach to displaying content functions and content.  To ensure proper display of the header and footer and sufficient spacing from the main content, we also set top and bottom margins and left and right padding, such as self.page-args += (margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 0em)) and self.padding = (x: 2em, y: 0em). The left and right margin is 0em to allow the header to occupy the full page width. The left and right spacing of the main content is achieved through left and right padding of 2em.  We also need to customize a slide method that accepts slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args). The first self: none is a required method parameter for getting the latest self. The second title is used to update self.bamboo-title for displaying in the header. The third ..args collects the remaining parameters and passes them to (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args), which is necessary for the Touying slide functionality to work properly. Additionally, we need to register this method in the register function with self.methods.slide = slide.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let register( aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], self, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 0em), ) self.padding = (x: 2em, y: 0em) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide,) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]     ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Special Slide​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/build-your-own-theme#custom-special-slide","content":" Building upon the basic slide, we further add some special slide functions such as title-slide, focus-slide, and a custom slides method.  For the title-slide method, first, we call self = utils.empty-page(self). This function clears self.page-args.header, self.page-args.footer, and sets margin and padding to 0em, creating a blank page effect. Then, we use let info = self.info + args.named() to get information stored in self.info and update it with the passed args.named() for later use as info.title. The specific page content body will vary for each theme, so we won't go into details here. Finally, we call `(self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body  ), where repeat: noneindicates that this page does not require animation effects, and passing thebody` parameter displays its content.  For the new-section-slide method, the process is similar. The only thing to note is that in (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body), we pass an additional section: section parameter to declare the creation of a new section. Another point to note is that besides self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide, we also register self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide, so new-section-slide will be automatically called when encountering a first-level title.  For the focus-slide method, most of the content is similar, but it's worth noting that we use self.page-args += (..) to update the page's background color.  Finally, we update the slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) method. When title-slide is true, using #show: slides will automatically create a title-slide. Setting slide-level: 1 indicates that the first-level and second-level titles correspond to section and title, respectively.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let title-slide(self: none, ..args) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let info = self.info + args.named() let body = { set align(center + horizon) block( fill: self.colors.primary, width: 80%, inset: (y: 1em), radius: 1em, text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, info.title) ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest) if info.author != none { block(info.author) } if info.date != none { block(if type(info.date) == datetime { info.date.display(self.datetime-format) } else { info.date }) } } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body) } #let new-section-slide(self: none, section) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let body = { set align(center + horizon) set text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.primary, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, style: &quot;italic&quot;) section } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body) } #let focus-slide(self: none, body) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) self.page-args += ( fill: self.colors.primary, margin: 2em, ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: 2em) (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, align(horizon + center, body)) } #let slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) = { if title-slide { (self.methods.title-slide)(self: self) } (self.methods.touying-slides)(self: self, slide-level: slide-level, ..args) } #let register( aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], self, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 0em), ) self.padding = (x: 2em, y: 0em) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.title-slide = title-slide self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.focus-slide = focus-slide self.methods.slides = slides self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], ) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, title-slide, focus-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ] #focus-slide[ Focus on it! ]     ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/build-your-own-theme#conclusion","content":" Congratulations!

Themes in Touying encapsulate some of their own global styles, which are placed in #show: init. For example, the university theme encapsulates the following:  self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 25pt) show footnote.entry: set text(size: .6em) body }   If you are not a theme creator but want to add your own global styles to your slides, you can simply place them after #show: init and before #show: slides. For example, the metropolis theme recommends adding the following global styles:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init // global styles #set text(font: &quot;Fira Sans&quot;, weight: &quot;light&quot;, size: 20pt) #show math.equation: set text(font: &quot;Fira Math&quot;) #set strong(delta: 100) #set par(justify: true) #show strong: alert #let (slide, title-slide, new-section-slide, focus-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides   However, note that you should not use #set page(..).

Global information is a typical example of this.  You can set the title, subtitle, author, date, and institution information for slides using:  #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], )   In subsequent slides, you can access them through s.info or self.info.  This information is generally used in the title-slide, header, and footer of the theme, for example:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution)   The date can accept datetime format or content format, and the display format for the datetime format can be changed using:  #let s = (s.methods.datetime-format)(self: s, &quot;[year]-[month]-[day]&quot;)   Principle Here, we will introduce a bit of OOP concept in Touying. You should know that Typst is a typesetting language that supports incremental rendering, which means Typst caches the results of previous function calls. This requires that Typst consists of pure functions, meaning functions that do not change external variables. Thus, it is challenging to modify a global variable in the true sense, even with the use of state or counter. This would require the use of locate with callback functions to obtain the values inside, and this approach would have a significant impact on performance. Touying does not use state or counter and does not violate the principle of pure functions in Typst. Instead, it uses a clever approach in an object-oriented style, maintaining a global singleton s. In Touying, an object refers to a Typst dictionary with its own member variables and methods. We agree that methods all have a named parameter self for passing the object itself, and methods are placed in the .methods domain. With this concept, it becomes easier to write methods to update info: #let s = ( info: (:), methods: ( // update info info: (self: none, ..args) =&gt; { self.info += args.named() self }, ) ) #let s = (s.methods.info)(self: s, title: [title]) Title is #s.info.title Now you can understand the purpose of the utils.methods() function: to bind self to all methods of s and return it, simplifying the subsequent usage through unpacking syntax. #let (init, slides, alert) = utils.methods(s)   ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"State Initialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Global Settings","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/global-settings#state-initialization","content":" In general, the two ways mentioned above are sufficient for adding global settings. However, there are still situations where we need to initialize counters or states. If you place this code before #show: slides, a blank page will be created, which is something we don't want to see. In such cases, you can use the s.methods.append-preamble method. For example, when using the codly package:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/codly:0.2.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let s = (s.methods.append-preamble)(self: s)[ #codly(languages: ( rust: (name: &quot;Rust&quot;, icon: &quot;\\u{fa53}&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#CE412B&quot;)), )) ] #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show heading.where(level: 2): set block(below: 1em) #show: init #show: codly-init.with() #let (slide,) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides #slide[ == First slide #raw(lang: &quot;rust&quot;, block: true, `pub fn main() { println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;); }`.text) ]     Or when configuring Pdfpc:  // Pdfpc configuration // typst query --root . ./example.typ --field value --one &quot;&lt;pdfpc-file&gt;&quot; &gt; ./example.pdfpc #let s = (s.methods.append-preamble)(self: s, pdfpc.config( duration-minutes: 30, start-time: datetime(hour: 14, minute: 10, second: 0), end-time: datetime(hour: 14, minute: 40, second: 0), last-minutes: 5, note-font-size: 12, disable-markdown: false, default-transition: ( type: &quot;push&quot;, duration-seconds: 2, angle: ltr, alignment: &quot;vertical&quot;, direction: &quot;inward&quot;, ), ))  ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Fletcher","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/integration/fletcher","content":"Fletcher Touying provides the touying-reducer, which adds pause and meanwhile animations to Fletcher.

You can write your slides in a &quot;content and style separation&quot; manner, especially with Typst, which offers a concise yet powerful syntax, better supporting content like code blocks, mathematical formulas, and theorems. Another advantage is that, with templates, writing slides with Touying is much faster than PowerPoint. Therefore, Touying is more suitable for users with a demand for &quot;research writing.&quot;Compared to Markdown Slides, Touying, relying on Typst, has more powerful typesetting control, such as headers, footers, layout, and convenient custom functions. These are capabilities that Markdown struggles to provide, or does not do well. Additionally, Touying offers #pause and #meanwhile markers, providing more convenient dynamic slide capabilities.Compared to Beamer, Touying has faster compilation speed, a more concise syntax, and simpler theme customization capabilities. Touying's compilation speed can be maintained in milliseconds or tens of milliseconds, compared to Beamer's compilation time of seconds or tens of seconds. Touying's syntax is more concise than Beamer, making it easier to change templates and create your own templates. In terms of features, Touying supports most of Beamer's capabilities and provides some convenient features that Beamer lacks.Compared to Polylux, Touying provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style syntax, allowing the simulation of &quot;global variables&quot; through a global singleton. This makes it easy to write themes. Touying does not rely on counter and locate to implement #pause, resulting in better performance.

However, padding is not a property of set page(..) but is obtained manually by adding #pad(..).Margin: Margins, including top, bottom, left, and right, are the core of Typst's page model. Other properties are influenced by margins, especially Header and Footer, which are actually inside the Margin.Padding: Used to add additional space between Margin and Content.Header: The Header is the content at the top of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can notice that the edge of the header container and padding does not align but has a certain gap. This gap is actually header-ascent: 30%, and the percentage is relative to margin-top. Also, we notice that the header innerbox is actually located at the bottom left corner of the header container, meaning the innerbox defaults to #set align(left + bottom).Footer: The Footer is the content at the bottom of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can notice that the edge of the footer container and padding does not align but has a certain gap. This gap is actually footer-descent: 30%, and the percentage is relative to margin-bottom. Also, we notice that the footer innerbox is actually located at the top left corner of the footer container, meaning the innerbox defaults to #set align(left + top).Place: The place function can achieve absolute positioning, relative to the parent container, without affecting other elements within the parent container. It can take parameters like alignment, dx, and dy, making it suitable for placing decorative elements such as logos.  Therefore, to apply Typst to create slides, we only need to set  #set page( margin: (x: 0em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, ) #let padding = (x: 4em, y: 0em)   For example, we have  #let container = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;), height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(fill: rgb(&quot;#d0d0d0&quot;)) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, margin: (x: 0em, y: 2em), header: container[#align(top)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Header]]], header-ascent: 0em, footer: container[#align(bottom)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Footer]]], footer-descent: 0em, ) #let padding = (x: 4em, y: 0em) #place(top + right)[↑Margin] #container[ #place[Padding] #pad(..padding)[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ] ]     ","version":"0.3.x","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Page Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Page Layout","url":"/touying/docs/0.3.x/layout#page-management","content":" Since using the set page(..) command in Typst to modify page parameters creates a new page and cannot modify the current one, Touying chooses to maintain an s.page-args member variable and an s.padding member variable. Touying applies these parameters only when creating new slides, so users only need to focus on s.page-args and s.padding.  For example, the previous example can be transformed into  #(s.page-args += ( margin: (x: 0em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, )) #(s.padding += (x: 4em, y: 0em))   Similarly, if you are not satisfied with the header or footer style of a theme, you can use  #(s.page-args.footer = [Custom Footer])   to replace it. However, please note that if you replace the page parameters in this way, you need to place it before #let (slide,) = utils.slides(s), or you need to call #let (slide,) = utils.slides(s) again.  Warning Therefore, you should not use the set page(..) command on your own; instead, you should modify the s.page-args member variable internally.  In this way, we can also query the current page parameters in real-time through s.page-args. This is useful for some functions that need to get margin or the current page's background color, such as transparent-cover. This is partly equivalent to the context get rule, and it is actually more convenient to use.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the required size and position of the logo often vary from person to person. Therefore, most of Touying's themes do not include configuration options for logos. But with the concepts of page layout mentioned in this section, we know that we can use the place function in the header or footer to place a logo image.  For example, suppose we decide to add the GitHub icon to the metropolis theme. We can implement it like this:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.3.1&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/octique:0.1.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.metropolis.register(s, aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #(s.page-args.header = self =&gt; { // display the original header utils.call-or-display(self, s.page-args.header) // place logo at the top-right place(top + right, dx: -0.5em, dy: 0.3em)[ #octique(&quot;mark-github&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#fafafa&quot;), width: 1.5em, height: 1.5em) ] }) #let (init, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(title: [Title])[ Logo example. ]     Here, utils.call-or-display(self, body) can be used to display body as content or a callback function in the form self =&gt; content.

The default parameter is utils.side-by-side.with(columns: auto, gutter: 1em).

There are many advantages to doing this:  Many times, we not only need the default #slide[...] but also special slide functions like #focus-slide[...].Different themes' #slide[...] functions may have more parameters than the default, such as the university theme's #slide[...] function having a subtitle parameter.Only slide functions can use the callback-style content block to achieve complex animation effects with #only and #uncover functions.It has a clearer structure.

This is because the simple theme registers an s.methods.touying-new-section-slide method, so Touying will automatically call this method.  If we don't want it to automatically create such a section slide, we can delete this method:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #(s.methods.touying-new-section-slide = none) #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = Title == First Slide Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst!     As you can see, there are only two pages left, and the default section slide is gone.  Similarly, we can register a new section slide:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #(s.methods.touying-new-section-slide = (self: none, section, ..args) =&gt; { self = utils.empty-page(self) (s.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, section: section, { set align(center + horizon) set text(size: 2em, fill: s.colors.primary, style: &quot;italic&quot;, weight: &quot;bold&quot;) section }, ..args) }) #let (init, slides, touying-outline) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = Title == First Slide Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst!     Similarly, we can modify s.methods.touying-new-subsection-slide to do the same for subsection.  In fact, besides s.methods.touying-new-section-slide, another special slide function is the s.methods.slide function, which will be called by default in simple style when #slide[...] is not explicitly used.  Also, since #slide[...] is registered in s.slides = (&quot;slide&quot;,), the section, subsection, and title parameters will be automatically passed, while others like #focus-slide[...] will not automatically receive these three parameters.  Principle In fact, you can also not use #show: slides and utils.slides(s), but only use utils.methods(s), for example: #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #let (init, touying-outline, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(section: [Title], title: [First Slide])[ Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst! ] Here, you need to manually pass in section, subsection, and title, but it will have better performance, suitable for cases where faster performance is needed, such as when there are more than dozens or hundreds of pages.

Later, we extract only, uncover, and alternatives functions from self using:  #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)   We then call these functions in subsequent steps.  Here's an interesting fact: the self.subslide of type int indicates the current subslide index, and in fact, the only, uncover, and alternatives functions rely on self.subslide to determine the current subslide index.  Warning We manually specify the repeat: 3 parameter, indicating the display of 3 subslides.

Generally, the first step in creating slides is to determine font size and page aspect ratio. Therefore, we need to register an initialization method:  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]   As you can see, we created a register function and passed an aspect-ratio parameter to set the page aspect ratio. We get default self by self: themes.default.register(). As you might already know, in Touying, we should not use set page(..) to set page parameters but rather use the syntax self.page-args += (..) to set them, as explained in the Page Layout section.  In addition, we registered a self.methods.init method, which can be used for some global style settings. For example, in this case, we added set text(size: 20pt) to set the font size. You can also place additional global style settings here, such as set par(justify: true). Since the init function is placed inside self.methods, it is a method, not a regular function. Therefore, we need to add the parameter self: none to use it properly.  As you can see, later in main.typ, we apply the global style settings in init using #show: init, where init is bound and unpacked through utils.methods(s).  If you pay extra attention, you'll notice that the register function has an independent self at the end. This actually represents returning the modified self as the return value, which will be saved in #let s = ... This line is therefore indispensable.

Touying provides built-in color theme support to minimize API differences between different themes. Touying offers two dimensions of color selection: the first is neutral, primary, secondary, and tertiary for hue distinction, with primary being the most commonly used; the second is default, light, lighter, lightest, dark, darker, and darkest for brightness distinction.  As we are creating the Bamboo theme, we chose a color for the primary theme, similar to bamboo (rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;)), and included neutral lightest/darkest as background and font colors.  As shown in the code below, we use (self.methods.colors)(self: self, ..) to modify the color theme. Essentially, it is a wrapper for self.colors += (..).  #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self }   After adding the color theme, we can access the color using syntax like self.colors.primary.  It's worth noting that users can change the theme color at any time using:  #let s = (s.methods.colors)(self: s, primary: rgb(&quot;#3578B9&quot;))   This flexibility demonstrates Touying's powerful customization capabilities.

Typically, #alert[..] emphasizes text using the primary theme color for aesthetics. We add a line in the register function:  self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it)   This code sets the text color to self.colors.primary, utilizing the theme's primary color.  ","version":"0.4.0+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Header and Footer​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.4.0+/build-your-own-theme#custom-header-and-footer","content":" Here, assuming you've already read the Page Layout section, we know we should add headers and footers to the slides.  Firstly, we add self.bamboo-title = []. This means we save the title of the current slide as a member variable self.bamboo-title, stored in self. This makes it easy to use in the header and later modifications. Similarly, we create self.bamboo-footer, saving the footer: [] parameter from the register function for displaying in the bottom-left corner.  It's worth noting that our header is actually a content function in the form of let header(self) = { .. } with the self parameter, allowing us to get the latest information from self. For example, self.bamboo-title. The footer is similar.  The components.cell used inside is actually #let cell = block.with(width: 100%, height: 100%, above: 0pt, below: 0pt, breakable: false), and show: components.cell is shorthand for components.cell(body). The show: pad.with(.4em) in the footer is similar.  Another point to note is the states module, which contains many counters and state-related content. For example, states.current-section-title is used to display the current section, and states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number is used to display the current page number and total number of pages.  We observe the usage of utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) to display self.bamboo-footer. This is used to handle situations like self.bamboo-footer = (self) =&gt; {..}, ensuring a unified approach to displaying content functions and content.  To ensure proper display of the header and footer and sufficient spacing from the main content, we also set margins, such as self.page-args += (margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em)).  We also need to customize a slide method that accepts slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args). The first self: none is a required method parameter for getting the latest self. The second title is used to update self.bamboo-title for displaying in the header. The third ..args collects the remaining parameters and passes them to (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args), which is necessary for the Touying slide functionality to work properly. Additionally, we need to register this method in the register function with self.methods.slide = slide.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em), ) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]     ","version":"0.4.0+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Special Slide​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.4.0+/build-your-own-theme#custom-special-slide","content":" Building upon the basic slide, we further add some special slide functions such as title-slide, focus-slide, and a custom slides method.  For the title-slide method, first, we call self = utils.empty-page(self). This function clears self.page-args.header, self.page-args.footer, and sets margin to 0em, creating a blank page effect. Then, we use let info = self.info + args.named() to get information stored in self.info and update it with the passed args.named() for later use as info.title. The specific page content body will vary for each theme, so we won't go into details here. Finally, we call `(self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body  ), where repeat: noneindicates that this page does not require animation effects, and passing thebody` parameter displays its content.  For the new-section-slide method, the process is similar. The only thing to note is that in (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body), we pass an additional section: section parameter to declare the creation of a new section. Another point to note is that besides self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide, we also register self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide, so new-section-slide will be automatically called when encountering a first-level title.  For the focus-slide method, most of the content is similar, but it's worth noting that we use self.page-args += (..) to update the page's background color.  Finally, we update the slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) method. When title-slide is true, using #show: slides will automatically create a title-slide. Setting slide-level: 1 indicates that the first-level and second-level titles correspond to section and title, respectively.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let title-slide(self: none, ..args) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let info = self.info + args.named() let body = { set align(center + horizon) block( fill: self.colors.primary, width: 80%, inset: (y: 1em), radius: 1em, text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, info.title) ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest) if info.author != none { block(info.author) } if info.date != none { block(if type(info.date) == datetime { info.date.display(self.datetime-format) } else { info.date }) } } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body) } #let new-section-slide(self: none, section) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let body = { set align(center + horizon) set text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.primary, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, style: &quot;italic&quot;) section } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body) } #let focus-slide(self: none, body) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) self.page-args += ( fill: self.colors.primary, margin: 2em, ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: 2em) (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, align(horizon + center, body)) } #let slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) = { if title-slide { (self.methods.title-slide)(self: self) } (self.methods.touying-slides)(self: self, slide-level: slide-level, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em), ) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.title-slide = title-slide self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.focus-slide = focus-slide self.methods.slides = slides self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], ) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide, title-slide, focus-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ] #focus-slide[ Focus on it! ]     ","version":"0.4.0+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/0.4.0+/build-your-own-theme#conclusion","content":" Congratulations!

Global information is a typical example of this.  You can set the title, subtitle, author, date, and institution information for slides using:  #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], )   In subsequent slides, you can access them through s.info or self.info.  This information is generally used in the title-slide, header, and footer of the theme, for example:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution)   The date can accept datetime format or content format, and the display format for the datetime format can be changed using:  #let s = (s.methods.datetime-format)(self: s, &quot;[year]-[month]-[day]&quot;)   Principle Here, we will introduce a bit of OOP concept in Touying. You should know that Typst is a typesetting language that supports incremental rendering, which means Typst caches the results of previous function calls. This requires that Typst consists of pure functions, meaning functions that do not change external variables. Thus, it is challenging to modify a global variable in the true sense, even with the use of state or counter. This would require the use of locate with callback functions to obtain the values inside, and this approach would have a significant impact on performance. Touying does not use state or counter and does not violate the principle of pure functions in Typst. Instead, it uses a clever approach in an object-oriented style, maintaining a global singleton s. In Touying, an object refers to a Typst dictionary with its own member variables and methods. We agree that methods all have a named parameter self for passing the object itself, and methods are placed in the .methods domain. With this concept, it becomes easier to write methods to update info: #let s = ( info: (:), methods: ( // update info info: (self: none, ..args) =&gt; { self.info += args.named() self }, ) ) #let s = (s.methods.info)(self: s, title: [title]) Title is #s.info.title Now you can understand the purpose of the utils.methods() function: to bind self to all methods of s and return it, simplifying the subsequent usage through unpacking syntax. #let (init, slides, alert) = utils.methods(s)   ","version":"0.4.0+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"State Initialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Global Settings","url":"/touying/docs/0.4.0+/global-settings#state-initialization","content":" In general, the two ways mentioned above are sufficient for adding global settings.

If you're not concerned with customizing page styles, you can choose to skip this section. However, it's still recommended to go through it.  Let's illustrate Typst's default page model through a specific example.  #let container = rect.with(height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;)) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, header: container[#innerbox[Header]], header-ascent: 30%, footer: container[#innerbox[Footer]], footer-descent: 30%, ) #place(top + right)[Margin→] #container[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ]     We need to distinguish the following concepts:  Model: Typst has a model similar to the CSS Box Model, divided into Margin, Padding, and Content. However, padding is not a property of set page(..) but is obtained by manually adding #pad(..).Margin: Margins are the edges of the page, divided into top, bottom, left, and right. They are the core of Typst's page model, and all other properties are influenced by margins, especially Header and Footer. Header and Footer are actually located within the Margin.Header: The Header is the content at the top of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can observe that the edge of the header container and padding does not align but has some space in between, which is actually header-ascent: 30%, where the percentage is relative to the margin-top. Additionally, we notice that the header innerbox is actually located at the bottom left corner of the header container, meaning innerbox defaults to #set align(left + bottom).Footer: The Footer is the content at the bottom of the page, similar to the Header but in the opposite direction.Place: The place function enables absolute positioning relative to the parent container without affecting other elements inside the parent container. It allows specifying alignment, dx, and dy, making it suitable for placing decorative elements like logos.  Therefore, to apply Typst to create slides, we only need to set:  #set page( margin: (x: 4em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, )   However, we still need to address how the header occupies the entire page width. Here, we use negative padding to achieve this. For instance:  #let container = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;), height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(fill: rgb(&quot;#d0d0d0&quot;)) #let margin = (x: 4em, y: 2em) // negative padding for header and footer #let negative-padding = pad.with(x: -margin.x, y: 0em) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, margin: margin, header: negative-padding[#container[#align(top)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Header]]]], header-ascent: 0em, footer: negative-padding[#container[#align(bottom)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Footer]]]], footer-descent: 0em, ) #place(top + right)[↑Margin→] #container[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ]     ","version":"0.4.0+","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Page Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Page Layout","url":"/touying/docs/0.4.0+/layout#page-management","content":" Since modifying page parameters using the set page(..) command in Typst creates a new page instead of modifying the current one, Touying chooses to maintain a s.page-args member variable and a s.padding member variable. These parameters are only applied when Touying creates a new slide, so users only need to focus on s.page-args and s.padding.  For example, the previous example can be modified as follows:  #(s.page-args += ( margin: (x: 4em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, ))   Touying automatically detects the value of margin.x and adds negative padding to the header if self.full-header == true.  Similarly, if you're unsatisfied with the header or footer style of a particular theme, you can change it using:  #(s.page-args.footer = [Custom Footer])   However, it's essential to note that if you change page parameters in this way, you need to place it before #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s), or you'll have to call #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) again.  Warning Therefore, you should not use the set page(..) command directly but instead modify the s.page-args member variable internally.  This approach also allows us to query the current page parameters in real-time using s.page-args, which is useful for functions that need to obtain margins or the current page's background color, such as transparent-cover. This is partially equivalent to context get rule and is actually more convenient to use.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the required size and position of the logo often vary from person to person. Therefore, most of Touying's themes do not include configuration options for logos. But with the concepts of page layout mentioned in this section, we know that we can use the place function in the header or footer to place a logo image.  For example, suppose we decide to add the GitHub icon to the metropolis theme. We can implement it like this:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.0&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/octique:0.1.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #(s.page-args.header = self =&gt; { // display the original header utils.call-or-display(self, s.page-args.header) // place logo at the top-right place(top + right, dx: -0.5em, dy: 0.3em)[ #octique(&quot;mark-github&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#fafafa&quot;), width: 1.5em, height: 1.5em) ] }) #let (init, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(title: [Title])[ Logo example. ]     Here, utils.call-or-display(self, body) can be used to display body as content or a callback function in the form self =&gt; content.

You can write your slides in a &quot;content and style separation&quot; manner, especially with Typst, which offers a concise yet powerful syntax, better supporting content like code blocks, mathematical formulas, and theorems. Another advantage is that, with templates, writing slides with Touying is much faster than PowerPoint. Therefore, Touying is more suitable for users with a demand for &quot;research writing.&quot;Compared to Markdown Slides, Touying, relying on Typst, has more powerful typesetting control, such as headers, footers, layout, and convenient custom functions. These are capabilities that Markdown struggles to provide, or does not do well. Additionally, Touying offers #pause and #meanwhile markers, providing more convenient dynamic slide capabilities.Compared to Beamer, Touying has faster compilation speed, a more concise syntax, and simpler theme customization capabilities. Touying's compilation speed can be maintained in milliseconds or tens of milliseconds, compared to Beamer's compilation time of seconds or tens of seconds. Touying's syntax is more concise than Beamer, making it easier to change templates and create your own templates. In terms of features, Touying supports most of Beamer's capabilities and provides some convenient features that Beamer lacks.Compared to Polylux, Touying provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style syntax, allowing the simulation of &quot;global variables&quot; through a global singleton. This makes it easy to write themes. Touying does not rely on counter and locate to implement #pause, resulting in better performance.

Later, we extract only, uncover, and alternatives functions from self using:  #let (uncover, only, alternatives) = utils.methods(self)   We then call these functions in subsequent steps.  Here's an interesting fact: the self.subslide of type int indicates the current subslide index, and in fact, the only, uncover, and alternatives functions rely on self.subslide to determine the current subslide index.

Generally, the first step in creating slides is to determine font size and page aspect ratio. Therefore, we need to register an initialization method:  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert, speaker-note) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]   As you can see, we created a register function and passed an aspect-ratio parameter to set the page aspect ratio. We get default self by self: themes.default.register(). As you might already know, in Touying, we should not use set page(..) to set page parameters but rather use the syntax self.page-args += (..) to set them, as explained in the Page Layout section.  In addition, we registered a self.methods.init method, which can be used for some global style settings. For example, in this case, we added set text(size: 20pt) to set the font size. You can also place additional global style settings here, such as set par(justify: true). Since the init function is placed inside self.methods, it is a method, not a regular function. Therefore, we need to add the parameter self: none to use it properly.  As you can see, later in main.typ, we apply the global style settings in init using #show: init, where init is bound and unpacked through utils.methods(s).  If you pay extra attention, you'll notice that the register function has an independent self at the end. This actually represents returning the modified self as the return value, which will be saved in #let s = ... This line is therefore indispensable.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Color Theme​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/next/build-your-own-theme#color-theme","content":" Choosing an attractive color theme for your slides is crucial. Touying provides built-in color theme support to minimize API differences between different themes. Touying offers two dimensions of color selection: the first is neutral, primary, secondary, and tertiary for hue distinction, with primary being the most commonly used; the second is default, light, lighter, lightest, dark, darker, and darkest for brightness distinction.  As we are creating the Bamboo theme, we chose a color for the primary theme, similar to bamboo (rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;)), and included neutral lightest/darkest as background and font colors.  As shown in the code below, we use (self.methods.colors)(self: self, ..) to modify the color theme. Essentially, it is a wrapper for self.colors += (..).  #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self }   After adding the color theme, we can access the color using syntax like self.colors.primary.  It's worth noting that users can change the theme color at any time using:  #let s = (s.methods.colors)(self: s, primary: rgb(&quot;#3578B9&quot;))   This flexibility demonstrates Touying's powerful customization capabilities.

We add a line in the register function:  self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it)   This code sets the text color to self.colors.primary, utilizing the theme's primary color.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Header and Footer​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/next/build-your-own-theme#custom-header-and-footer","content":" Here, assuming you've already read the Page Layout section, we know we should add headers and footers to the slides.  Firstly, we add self.bamboo-title = []. This means we save the title of the current slide as a member variable self.bamboo-title, stored in self. This makes it easy to use in the header and later modifications. Similarly, we create self.bamboo-footer, saving the footer: [] parameter from the register function for displaying in the bottom-left corner.  It's worth noting that our header is actually a content function in the form of let header(self) = { .. } with the self parameter, allowing us to get the latest information from self. For example, self.bamboo-title. The footer is similar.  The components.cell used inside is actually #let cell = block.with(width: 100%, height: 100%, above: 0pt, below: 0pt, breakable: false), and show: components.cell is shorthand for components.cell(body). The show: pad.with(.4em) in the footer is similar.  Another point to note is the states module, which contains many counters and state-related content. For example, states.current-section-title is used to display the current section, and states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number is used to display the current page number and total number of pages.  We observe the usage of utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) to display self.bamboo-footer. This is used to handle situations like self.bamboo-footer = (self) =&gt; {..}, ensuring a unified approach to displaying content functions and content.  To ensure proper display of the header and footer and sufficient spacing from the main content, we also set margins, such as self.page-args += (margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em)).  We also need to customize a slide method that accepts slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args). The first self: none is a required method parameter for getting the latest self. The second title is used to update self.bamboo-title for displaying in the header. The third ..args collects the remaining parameters and passes them to (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args), which is necessary for the Touying slide functionality to work properly. Additionally, we need to register this method in the register function with self.methods.slide = slide.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em), ) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert, speaker-note) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]     ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Special Slide​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/next/build-your-own-theme#custom-special-slide","content":" Building upon the basic slide, we further add some special slide functions such as title-slide, focus-slide, and a custom slides method.  For the title-slide method, first, we call self = utils.empty-page(self). This function clears self.page-args.header, self.page-args.footer, and sets margin to 0em, creating a blank page effect. Then, we use let info = self.info + args.named() to get information stored in self.info and update it with the passed args.named() for later use as info.title. The specific page content body will vary for each theme, so we won't go into details here. Finally, we call `(self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body  ), where repeat: noneindicates that this page does not require animation effects, and passing thebody` parameter displays its content.  For the new-section-slide method, the process is similar. The only thing to note is that in (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body), we pass an additional section: section parameter to declare the creation of a new section. Another point to note is that besides self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide, we also register self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide, so new-section-slide will be automatically called when encountering a first-level title.

Finally, we update the slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) method. When title-slide is true, using #show: slides will automatically create a title-slide.

This is because the simple theme registers an s.methods.touying-new-section-slide method, so Touying will automatically call this method.  If we don't want it to automatically create such a section slide, we can delete this method:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #(s.methods.touying-new-section-slide = none) #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = Title == First Slide Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst!     As you can see, there are only two pages left, and the default section slide is gone.  Similarly, we can register a new section slide:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #(s.methods.touying-new-section-slide = (self: none, section, ..args) =&gt; { self = utils.empty-page(self) (s.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, section: section, { set align(center + horizon) set text(size: 2em, fill: s.colors.primary, style: &quot;italic&quot;, weight: &quot;bold&quot;) section }, ..args) }) #let (init, slides, touying-outline) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = Title == First Slide Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst!     Similarly, we can modify s.methods.touying-new-subsection-slide to do the same for subsection.  In fact, besides s.methods.touying-new-section-slide, another special slide function is the s.methods.slide function, which will be called by default in simple style when #slide[...] is not explicitly used.  Also, since #slide[...] is registered in s.slides = (&quot;slide&quot;,), the section, subsection, and title parameters will be automatically passed, while others like #focus-slide[...] will not automatically receive these three parameters.  Principle In fact, you can also not use #show: slides and utils.slides(s), but only use utils.methods(s), for example: #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #let (init, touying-outline, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(section: [Title], title: [First Slide])[ Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst! ] Here, you need to manually pass in section, subsection, and title, but it will have better performance, suitable for cases where faster performance is needed, such as when there are more than dozens or hundreds of pages.

Themes in Touying encapsulate some of their own global styles, which are placed in #show: init. For example, the university theme encapsulates the following:  self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 25pt) show footnote.entry: set text(size: .6em) body }   If you are not a theme creator but want to add your own global styles to your slides, you can simply place them after #show: init and before #show: slides.

Global information is a typical example of this.  You can set the title, subtitle, author, date, and institution information for slides using:  #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], )   In subsequent slides, you can access them through s.info or self.info.  This information is generally used in the title-slide, header, and footer of the theme, for example:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution)   The date can accept datetime format or content format, and the display format for the datetime format can be changed using:  #let s = (s.methods.datetime-format)(self: s, &quot;[year]-[month]-[day]&quot;)   Principle Here, we will introduce a bit of OOP concept in Touying. You should know that Typst is a typesetting language that supports incremental rendering, which means Typst caches the results of previous function calls. This requires that Typst consists of pure functions, meaning functions that do not change external variables. Thus, it is challenging to modify a global variable in the true sense, even with the use of state or counter. This would require the use of locate with callback functions to obtain the values inside, and this approach would have a significant impact on performance. Touying does not use state or counter and does not violate the principle of pure functions in Typst. Instead, it uses a clever approach in an object-oriented style, maintaining a global singleton s. In Touying, an object refers to a Typst dictionary with its own member variables and methods. We agree that methods all have a named parameter self for passing the object itself, and methods are placed in the .methods domain. With this concept, it becomes easier to write methods to update info: #let s = ( info: (:), methods: ( // update info info: (self: none, ..args) =&gt; { self.info += args.named() self }, ) ) #let s = (s.methods.info)(self: s, title: [title]) Title is #s.info.title Now you can understand the purpose of the utils.methods() function: to bind self to all methods of s and return it, simplifying the subsequent usage through unpacking syntax. #let (init, slides, alert) = utils.methods(s)   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"State Initialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Global Settings","url":"/touying/docs/next/global-settings#state-initialization","content":" In general, the two ways mentioned above are sufficient for adding global settings. However, there are still situations where we need to initialize counters or states. If you place this code before #show: slides, a blank page will be created, which is something we don't want to see. In such cases, you can use the s.methods.append-preamble method. For example, when using the codly package:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/codly:0.2.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let s = (s.methods.append-preamble)(self: s)[ #codly(languages: ( rust: (name: &quot;Rust&quot;, icon: &quot;\\u{fa53}&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#CE412B&quot;)), )) ] #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show heading.where(level: 2): set block(below: 1em) #show: init #show: codly-init.with() #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides #slide[ == First slide #raw(lang: &quot;rust&quot;, block: true, `pub fn main() { println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;); }`.text) ]     Or when configuring Pdfpc:  // Pdfpc configuration // typst query --root . ./example.typ --field value --one &quot;&lt;pdfpc-file&gt;&quot; &gt; ./example.pdfpc #let s = (s.methods.append-preamble)(self: s, pdfpc.config( duration-minutes: 30, start-time: datetime(hour: 14, minute: 10, second: 0), end-time: datetime(hour: 14, minute: 40, second: 0), last-minutes: 5, note-font-size: 12, disable-markdown: false, default-transition: ( type: &quot;push&quot;, duration-seconds: 2, angle: ltr, alignment: &quot;vertical&quot;, direction: &quot;inward&quot;, ), ))  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Introduction to Touying","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/touying/docs/next/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Why Use Touying​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Introduction to Touying","url":"/touying/docs/next/intro#why-use-touying","content":" Unlike PowerPoint, Touying is not a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; tool. You can write your slides in a &quot;content and style separation&quot; manner, especially with Typst, which offers a concise yet powerful syntax, better supporting content like code blocks, mathematical formulas, and theorems. Another advantage is that, with templates, writing slides with Touying is much faster than PowerPoint. Therefore, Touying is more suitable for users with a demand for &quot;research writing.&quot;Compared to Markdown Slides, Touying, relying on Typst, has more powerful typesetting control, such as headers, footers, layout, and convenient custom functions. These are capabilities that Markdown struggles to provide, or does not do well. Additionally, Touying offers #pause and #meanwhile markers, providing more convenient dynamic slide capabilities.Compared to Beamer, Touying has faster compilation speed, a more concise syntax, and simpler theme customization capabilities. Touying's compilation speed can be maintained in milliseconds or tens of milliseconds, compared to Beamer's compilation time of seconds or tens of seconds. Touying's syntax is more concise than Beamer, making it easier to change templates and create your own templates. In terms of features, Touying supports most of Beamer's capabilities and provides some convenient features that Beamer lacks.Compared to Polylux, Touying provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style syntax, allowing the simulation of &quot;global variables&quot; through a global singleton. This makes it easy to write themes. Touying does not rely on counter and locate to implement #pause, resulting in better performance.

They are the core of Typst's page model, and all other properties are influenced by margins, especially Header and Footer. Header and Footer are actually located within the Margin.Header: The Header is the content at the top of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can observe that the edge of the header container and padding does not align but has some space in between, which is actually header-ascent: 30%, where the percentage is relative to the margin-top. Additionally, we notice that the header innerbox is actually located at the bottom left corner of the header container, meaning innerbox defaults to #set align(left + bottom).Footer: The Footer is the content at the bottom of the page, similar to the Header but in the opposite direction.Place: The place function enables absolute positioning relative to the parent container without affecting other elements inside the parent container. It allows specifying alignment, dx, and dy, making it suitable for placing decorative elements like logos.  Therefore, to apply Typst to create slides, we only need to set:  #set page( margin: (x: 4em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, )   However, we still need to address how the header occupies the entire page width. Here, we use negative padding to achieve this. For instance:  #let container = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;), height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(fill: rgb(&quot;#d0d0d0&quot;)) #let margin = (x: 4em, y: 2em) // negative padding for header and footer #let negative-padding = pad.with(x: -margin.x, y: 0em) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, margin: margin, header: negative-padding[#container[#align(top)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Header]]]], header-ascent: 0em, footer: negative-padding[#container[#align(bottom)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Footer]]]], footer-descent: 0em, ) #place(top + right)[↑Margin→] #container[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ]     ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Page Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Page Layout","url":"/touying/docs/next/layout#page-management","content":" Since modifying page parameters using the set page(..) command in Typst creates a new page instead of modifying the current one, Touying chooses to maintain a s.page-args member variable and a s.padding member variable. These parameters are only applied when Touying creates a new slide, so users only need to focus on s.page-args and s.padding.  For example, the previous example can be modified as follows:  #(s.page-args += ( margin: (x: 4em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, ))   Touying automatically detects the value of margin.x and adds negative padding to the header if self.full-header == true.  Similarly, if you're unsatisfied with the header or footer style of a particular theme, you can change it using:  #(s.page-args.footer = [Custom Footer])   However, it's essential to note that if you change page parameters in this way, you need to place it before #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s), or you'll have to call #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) again.  Warning Therefore, you should not use the set page(..) command directly but instead modify the s.page-args member variable internally.  This approach also allows us to query the current page parameters in real-time using s.page-args, which is useful for functions that need to obtain margins or the current page's background color, such as transparent-cover. This is partially equivalent to context get rule and is actually more convenient to use.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the required size and position of the logo often vary from person to person. Therefore, most of Touying's themes do not include configuration options for logos.

For example, suppose we decide to add the GitHub icon to the metropolis theme. We can implement it like this:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/octique:0.1.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #(s.page-args.header = self =&gt; { // display the original header utils.call-or-display(self, s.page-args.header) // place logo at the top-right place(top + right, dx: -0.5em, dy: 0.3em)[ #octique(&quot;mark-github&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#fafafa&quot;), width: 1.5em, height: 1.5em) ] }) #let (init, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(title: [Title])[ Logo example. ]     Here, utils.call-or-display(self, body) can be used to display body as content or a callback function in the form self =&gt; content.

Therefore, we need to register an initialization method:  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert, speaker-note) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]   As you can see, we created a register function and passed an aspect-ratio parameter to set the page aspect ratio. We get default self by self: themes.default.register(). As you might already know, in Touying, we should not use set page(..) to set page parameters but rather use the syntax self.page-args += (..) to set them, as explained in the Page Layout section.  In addition, we registered a self.methods.init method, which can be used for some global style settings. For example, in this case, we added set text(size: 20pt) to set the font size. You can also place additional global style settings here, such as set par(justify: true). Since the init function is placed inside self.methods, it is a method, not a regular function. Therefore, we need to add the parameter self: none to use it properly.  As you can see, later in main.typ, we apply the global style settings in init using #show: init, where init is bound and unpacked through utils.methods(s).  If you pay extra attention, you'll notice that the register function has an independent self at the end. This actually represents returning the modified self as the return value, which will be saved in #let s = ... This line is therefore indispensable.  ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Color Theme​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/build-your-own-theme#color-theme","content":" Choosing an attractive color theme for your slides is crucial. Touying provides built-in color theme support to minimize API differences between different themes. Touying offers two dimensions of color selection: the first is neutral, primary, secondary, and tertiary for hue distinction, with primary being the most commonly used; the second is default, light, lighter, lightest, dark, darker, and darkest for brightness distinction.  As we are creating the Bamboo theme, we chose a color for the primary theme, similar to bamboo (rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;)), and included neutral lightest/darkest as background and font colors.  As shown in the code below, we use (self.methods.colors)(self: self, ..) to modify the color theme. Essentially, it is a wrapper for self.colors += (..).  #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, ) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self }   After adding the color theme, we can access the color using syntax like self.colors.primary.  It's worth noting that users can change the theme color at any time using:  #let s = (s.methods.colors)(self: s, primary: rgb(&quot;#3578B9&quot;))   This flexibility demonstrates Touying's powerful customization capabilities.  ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Practical: Custom Alert Method​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/build-your-own-theme#practical-custom-alert-method","content":" In general, we need to provide a #alert[..] function for users, similar to #strong[..]. Typically, #alert[..] emphasizes text using the primary theme color for aesthetics. We add a line in the register function:  self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it)   This code sets the text color to self.colors.primary, utilizing the theme's primary color.  ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Header and Footer​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/build-your-own-theme#custom-header-and-footer","content":" Here, assuming you've already read the Page Layout section, we know we should add headers and footers to the slides.  Firstly, we add self.bamboo-title = []. This means we save the title of the current slide as a member variable self.bamboo-title, stored in self. This makes it easy to use in the header and later modifications. Similarly, we create self.bamboo-footer, saving the footer: [] parameter from the register function for displaying in the bottom-left corner.  It's worth noting that our header is actually a content function in the form of let header(self) = { .. } with the self parameter, allowing us to get the latest information from self. For example, self.bamboo-title. The footer is similar.  The components.cell used inside is actually #let cell = block.with(width: 100%, height: 100%, above: 0pt, below: 0pt, breakable: false), and show: components.cell is shorthand for components.cell(body). The show: pad.with(.4em) in the footer is similar.  Another point to note is the states module, which contains many counters and state-related content. For example, states.current-section-title is used to display the current section, and states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number is used to display the current page number and total number of pages.  We observe the usage of utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) to display self.bamboo-footer. This is used to handle situations like self.bamboo-footer = (self) =&gt; {..}, ensuring a unified approach to displaying content functions and content.  To ensure proper display of the header and footer and sufficient spacing from the main content, we also set margins, such as self.page-args += (margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em)).  We also need to customize a slide method that accepts slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args). The first self: none is a required method parameter for getting the latest self. The second title is used to update self.bamboo-title for displaying in the header. The third ..args collects the remaining parameters and passes them to (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args), which is necessary for the Touying slide functionality to work properly. Additionally, we need to register this method in the register function with self.methods.slide = slide.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em), ) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert, speaker-note) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ]     ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Special Slide​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/build-your-own-theme#custom-special-slide","content":" Building upon the basic slide, we further add some special slide functions such as title-slide, focus-slide, and a custom slides method.  For the title-slide method, first, we call self = utils.empty-page(self). This function clears self.page-args.header, self.page-args.footer, and sets margin to 0em, creating a blank page effect. Then, we use let info = self.info + args.named() to get information stored in self.info and update it with the passed args.named() for later use as info.title. The specific page content body will vary for each theme, so we won't go into details here. Finally, we call `(self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body  ), where repeat: noneindicates that this page does not require animation effects, and passing thebody` parameter displays its content.  For the new-section-slide method, the process is similar. The only thing to note is that in (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body), we pass an additional section: section parameter to declare the creation of a new section. Another point to note is that besides self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide, we also register self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide, so new-section-slide will be automatically called when encountering a first-level title.  For the focus-slide method, most of the content is similar, but it's worth noting that we use self.page-args += (..) to update the page's background color.  Finally, we update the slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) method. When title-slide is true, using #show: slides will automatically create a title-slide. Setting slide-level: 1 indicates that the first-level and second-level titles correspond to section and title, respectively.  // bamboo.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let slide(self: none, title: auto, ..args) = { if title != auto { self.bamboo-title = title } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, ..args) } #let title-slide(self: none, ..args) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let info = self.info + args.named() let body = { set align(center + horizon) block( fill: self.colors.primary, width: 80%, inset: (y: 1em), radius: 1em, text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, info.title) ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest) if info.author != none { block(info.author) } if info.date != none { block(if type(info.date) == datetime { info.date.display(self.datetime-format) } else { info.date }) } } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, body) } #let new-section-slide(self: none, section) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) let body = { set align(center + horizon) set text(size: 2em, fill: self.colors.primary, weight: &quot;bold&quot;, style: &quot;italic&quot;) section } (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, section: section, body) } #let focus-slide(self: none, body) = { self = utils.empty-page(self) self.page-args += ( fill: self.colors.primary, margin: 2em, ) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: 2em) (self.methods.touying-slide)(self: self, repeat: none, align(horizon + center, body)) } #let slides(self: none, title-slide: true, slide-level: 1, ..args) = { if title-slide { (self.methods.title-slide)(self: self) } (self.methods.touying-slides)(self: self, slide-level: slide-level, ..args) } #let register( self: themes.default.register(), aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: [], ) = { // color theme self = (self.methods.colors)( self: self, primary: rgb(&quot;#5E8B65&quot;), neutral-lightest: rgb(&quot;#ffffff&quot;), neutral-darkest: rgb(&quot;#000000&quot;), ) // variables for later use self.bamboo-title = [] self.bamboo-footer = footer // set page let header(self) = { set align(top) show: components.cell.with(fill: self.colors.primary, inset: 1em) set align(horizon) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-lightest, size: .7em) states.current-section-title linebreak() set text(size: 1.5em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-title) } let footer(self) = { set align(bottom) show: pad.with(.4em) set text(fill: self.colors.neutral-darkest, size: .8em) utils.call-or-display(self, self.bamboo-footer) h(1fr) states.slide-counter.display() + &quot; / &quot; + states.last-slide-number } self.page-args += ( paper: &quot;presentation-&quot; + aspect-ratio, header: header, footer: footer, margin: (top: 4em, bottom: 1.5em, x: 2em), ) // register methods self.methods.slide = slide self.methods.title-slide = title-slide self.methods.new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.touying-new-section-slide = new-section-slide self.methods.focus-slide = focus-slide self.methods.slides = slides self.methods.alert = (self: none, it) =&gt; text(fill: self.colors.primary, it) self.methods.init = (self: none, body) =&gt; { set text(size: 20pt) body } self } // main.typ #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;bamboo.typ&quot; #let s = bamboo.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution) #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], ) #let (init, slides, touying-outline, alert, speaker-note) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #show strong: alert #let (slide, empty-slide, title-slide, focus-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = First Section == First Slide #slide[ A slide with a title and an *important* information. ] #focus-slide[ Focus on it! ]     ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating Your Own Theme","url":"/touying/docs/build-your-own-theme#conclusion","content":" Congratulations!

This is because the simple theme registers an s.methods.touying-new-section-slide method, so Touying will automatically call this method.  If we don't want it to automatically create such a section slide, we can delete this method:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #let s = themes.simple.register() #(s.methods.touying-new-section-slide = none) #let (init, slides) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) #show: slides = Title == First Slide Hello, Touying! #pause Hello, Typst!

Similarly, we can modify s.methods.touying-new-subsection-slide to do the same for subsection.

Global information is a typical example of this.  You can set the title, subtitle, author, date, and institution information for slides using:  #let s = (s.methods.info)( self: s, title: [Title], subtitle: [Subtitle], author: [Authors], date: datetime.today(), institution: [Institution], )   In subsequent slides, you can access them through s.info or self.info.  This information is generally used in the title-slide, header, and footer of the theme, for example:  #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;, footer: self =&gt; self.info.institution)   The date can accept datetime format or content format, and the display format for the datetime format can be changed using:  #let s = (s.methods.datetime-format)(self: s, &quot;[year]-[month]-[day]&quot;)   Principle Here, we will introduce a bit of OOP concept in Touying. You should know that Typst is a typesetting language that supports incremental rendering, which means Typst caches the results of previous function calls. This requires that Typst consists of pure functions, meaning functions that do not change external variables. Thus, it is challenging to modify a global variable in the true sense, even with the use of state or counter. This would require the use of locate with callback functions to obtain the values inside, and this approach would have a significant impact on performance. Touying does not use state or counter and does not violate the principle of pure functions in Typst. Instead, it uses a clever approach in an object-oriented style, maintaining a global singleton s. In Touying, an object refers to a Typst dictionary with its own member variables and methods. We agree that methods all have a named parameter self for passing the object itself, and methods are placed in the .methods domain. With this concept, it becomes easier to write methods to update info: #let s = ( info: (:), methods: ( // update info info: (self: none, ..args) =&gt; { self.info += args.named() self }, ) ) #let s = (s.methods.info)(self: s, title: [title]) Title is #s.info.title Now you can understand the purpose of the utils.methods() function: to bind self to all methods of s and return it, simplifying the subsequent usage through unpacking syntax. #let (init, slides, alert) = utils.methods(s)   ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"State Initialization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Global Settings","url":"/touying/docs/global-settings#state-initialization","content":" In general, the two ways mentioned above are sufficient for adding global settings.

You can write your slides in a &quot;content and style separation&quot; manner, especially with Typst, which offers a concise yet powerful syntax, better supporting content like code blocks, mathematical formulas, and theorems. Another advantage is that, with templates, writing slides with Touying is much faster than PowerPoint. Therefore, Touying is more suitable for users with a demand for &quot;research writing.&quot;Compared to Markdown Slides, Touying, relying on Typst, has more powerful typesetting control, such as headers, footers, layout, and convenient custom functions. These are capabilities that Markdown struggles to provide, or does not do well. Additionally, Touying offers #pause and #meanwhile markers, providing more convenient dynamic slide capabilities.Compared to Beamer, Touying has faster compilation speed, a more concise syntax, and simpler theme customization capabilities. Touying's compilation speed can be maintained in milliseconds or tens of milliseconds, compared to Beamer's compilation time of seconds or tens of seconds. Touying's syntax is more concise than Beamer, making it easier to change templates and create your own templates. In terms of features, Touying supports most of Beamer's capabilities and provides some convenient features that Beamer lacks.Compared to Polylux, Touying provides an object-oriented programming (OOP) style syntax, allowing the simulation of &quot;global variables&quot; through a global singleton. This makes it easy to write themes. Touying does not rely on counter and locate to implement #pause, resulting in better performance.

If you're not concerned with customizing page styles, you can choose to skip this section. However, it's still recommended to go through it.  Let's illustrate Typst's default page model through a specific example.  #let container = rect.with(height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;)) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, header: container[#innerbox[Header]], header-ascent: 30%, footer: container[#innerbox[Footer]], footer-descent: 30%, ) #place(top + right)[Margin→] #container[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ]     We need to distinguish the following concepts:  Model: Typst has a model similar to the CSS Box Model, divided into Margin, Padding, and Content. However, padding is not a property of set page(..) but is obtained by manually adding #pad(..).Margin: Margins are the edges of the page, divided into top, bottom, left, and right. They are the core of Typst's page model, and all other properties are influenced by margins, especially Header and Footer. Header and Footer are actually located within the Margin.Header: The Header is the content at the top of the page, divided into container and innerbox. We can observe that the edge of the header container and padding does not align but has some space in between, which is actually header-ascent: 30%, where the percentage is relative to the margin-top. Additionally, we notice that the header innerbox is actually located at the bottom left corner of the header container, meaning innerbox defaults to #set align(left + bottom).Footer: The Footer is the content at the bottom of the page, similar to the Header but in the opposite direction.Place: The place function enables absolute positioning relative to the parent container without affecting other elements inside the parent container. It allows specifying alignment, dx, and dy, making it suitable for placing decorative elements like logos.  Therefore, to apply Typst to create slides, we only need to set:  #set page( margin: (x: 4em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, )   However, we still need to address how the header occupies the entire page width. Here, we use negative padding to achieve this. For instance:  #let container = rect.with(stroke: (dash: &quot;dashed&quot;), height: 100%, width: 100%, inset: 0pt) #let innerbox = rect.with(fill: rgb(&quot;#d0d0d0&quot;)) #let margin = (x: 4em, y: 2em) // negative padding for header and footer #let negative-padding = pad.with(x: -margin.x, y: 0em) #set text(size: 30pt) #set page( paper: &quot;presentation-16-9&quot;, margin: margin, header: negative-padding[#container[#align(top)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Header]]]], header-ascent: 0em, footer: negative-padding[#container[#align(bottom)[#innerbox(width: 100%)[Footer]]]], footer-descent: 0em, ) #place(top + right)[↑Margin→] #container[ #container[ #innerbox[Content] ] ]     ","version":"0.4.1","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Page Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Page Layout","url":"/touying/docs/layout#page-management","content":" Since modifying page parameters using the set page(..) command in Typst creates a new page instead of modifying the current one, Touying chooses to maintain a s.page-args member variable and a s.padding member variable. These parameters are only applied when Touying creates a new slide, so users only need to focus on s.page-args and s.padding.  For example, the previous example can be modified as follows:  #(s.page-args += ( margin: (x: 4em, y: 2em), header: align(top)[Header], footer: align(bottom)[Footer], header-ascent: 0em, footer-descent: 0em, ))   Touying automatically detects the value of margin.x and adds negative padding to the header if self.full-header == true.  Similarly, if you're unsatisfied with the header or footer style of a particular theme, you can change it using:  #(s.page-args.footer = [Custom Footer])   However, it's essential to note that if you change page parameters in this way, you need to place it before #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s), or you'll have to call #let (slide, empty-slide) = utils.slides(s) again.  Warning Therefore, you should not use the set page(..) command directly but instead modify the s.page-args member variable internally.  This approach also allows us to query the current page parameters in real-time using s.page-args, which is useful for functions that need to obtain margins or the current page's background color, such as transparent-cover. This is partially equivalent to context get rule and is actually more convenient to use.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the required size and position of the logo often vary from person to person. Therefore, most of Touying's themes do not include configuration options for logos. But with the concepts of page layout mentioned in this section, we know that we can use the place function in the header or footer to place a logo image.  For example, suppose we decide to add the GitHub icon to the metropolis theme. We can implement it like this:  #import &quot;@preview/touying:0.4.1&quot;: * #import &quot;@preview/octique:0.1.0&quot;: * #let s = themes.metropolis.register(aspect-ratio: &quot;16-9&quot;) #(s.page-args.header = self =&gt; { // display the original header utils.call-or-display(self, s.page-args.header) // place logo at the top-right place(top + right, dx: -0.5em, dy: 0.3em)[ #octique(&quot;mark-github&quot;, color: rgb(&quot;#fafafa&quot;), width: 1.5em, height: 1.5em) ] }) #let (init, slide) = utils.methods(s) #show: init #slide(title: [Title])[ Logo example. ]     Here, utils.call-or-display(self, body) can be used to display body as content or a callback function in the form self =&gt; content.
