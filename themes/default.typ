/// Touying slide function.
///
/// - `config` is the configuration of the slide. You can use `config-xxx` to set the configuration of the slide. For more several configurations, you can use `utils.merge-dicts` to merge them.
///
/// - `repeat` is the number of subslides. Default is `auto`，which means touying will automatically calculate the number of subslides.
///
///   The `repeat` argument is necessary when you use `#slide(repeat: 3, self => [ .. ])` style code to create a slide. The callback-style `uncover` and `only` cannot be detected by touying automatically.
///
/// - `setting` is the setting of the slide. You can use it to add some set/show rules for the slide.
///
/// - `composer` is the composer of the slide. You can use it to set the layout of the slide.
///
///   For example, `#slide(composer: (1fr, 2fr, 1fr))[A][B][C]` to split the slide into three parts. The first and the last parts will take 1/4 of the slide, and the second part will take 1/2 of the slide.
///
///   If you pass a non-function value like `(1fr, 2fr, 1fr)`, it will be assumed to be the first argument of the `components.side-by-side` function.
///
///   The `components.side-by-side` function is a simple wrapper of the `grid` function. It means you can use the `grid.cell(colspan: 2, ..)` to make the cell take 2 columns.
///
///   For example, `#slide(composer: 2)[A][B][#grid.cell(colspan: 2)[Footer]] will make the `Footer` cell take 2 columns.
///
///   If you want to customize the composer, you can pass a function to the `composer` argument. The function should receive the contents of the slide and return the content of the slide, like `#slide(composer: grid.with(columns: 2))[A][B]`.
///
/// - `..bodies` is the contents of the slide. You can call the `slide` function with syntax like `#slide[A][B][C]` to create a slide.
